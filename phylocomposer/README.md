This directory contains files for using phylocomposer (in the DART
package) to generate the pair HMM for finding the overlap of two
reads, each of which is derived from a reference by a Quaff transducer
model.

None of this is necessary to build, run or use quaff: it's
documentation that's internal to the project. Nothing to see here.
